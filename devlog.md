# Dev Log
## 03-10-2025 19:00
Kicked off the project by reviewing the full set of requirements and diving into research on the Vigenère cipher. I spent some time exploring resources like GeeksForGeeks and watched a couple of YouTube tutorials to get a deeper understanding of how the cipher works and how it can be implemented effectively in Java.

## 03-11-2025 14:06
Set up the initial structure for the project on my local machine. Created the three Java files that would form the backbone of the application and began implementing the Logger class. The goal was to build a solid foundation for logging important system events and tracking the flow of the program during execution.

Project timeline got extended, so I decided to temporarily pause work and revisit it later. Took a quick break from active development but kept the project in the back of my mind.

## 03-20-2025 14:00
Created a new GitHub repository to centralize project management and ensure version control. This would help streamline the development process and allow for easy tracking of progress and code changes.

## 03-20-2025 14:03
Created the first file on GitHub (Logger.java). This was the core component for capturing all program activity and maintaining logs, which would be helpful for troubleshooting and debugging later in the process.

## 03-20-2025 14:10
Added the Driver.java and Encryption.java files to GitHub. These files were essential for implementing the cipher logic and managing user input and interactions. The structure was coming together nicely.

## 03-21-2025 00:04
Focused on implementing the Logger class, which was responsible for writing time-stamped log messages to a file. This was crucial for keeping track of events as they occurred in the program, particularly for debugging and understanding how the system was processing data.

## 03-23-2025 01:05
Ran some initial tests on the logging functionality to ensure that the Logger class was correctly outputting information to a file. Successfully committed the changes to GitHub and continued to refine the setup.

## 03-23-2025 02:32
Integrated the Vigenere cipher logic into the project. Added basic commands for the user interface, including: password, encrypt, decryptr, and quit. Focused on ensuring the cipher only worked with uppercase letters to simplify the encryption/decryption process. During testing, encountered an issue with the encryption logic. After digging into the cipher's implementation, I realized I had missed some critical functionality. I researched further on GeeksForGeeks and found the missing piece to fix the encryption flow. 

## 03-23-2025 03:27
Developed the Driver to manage user interaction. Researched about Processes again. Integrated the Logger and Encryption programs as subprocesses. Established communication using input/output streams. Implemented command handling for user input. Added history tracking for encrypted/decrypted messages.

## 03-24 01:46
Carried out extensive functional testing to ensure that the project was running smoothly. Verified that the logging system was properly capturing all user commands and results, and made some small tweaks to improve the user interface messages. The system was starting to take shape!

## 03-24-2025 11:03
Committed the latest updates to both Encryption.java and Driver.java, making sure all changes were properly pushed to GitHub for version tracking.

## 03-24-2025 11:49
Ran a final round of tests on the project to check for any remaining issues. The functionality was solid, so I decided to make some final adjustments to the Logger.java file and uploaded it to GitHub to ensure everything was up to date.

## 03-24-2025 21:54
Created a comprehensive README.md file to help users understand how to run the project and what each file does. This will be useful for anyone who wants to use the project in the future.

## 03-24-2025 22:20
Uploaded the completed devlog to GitHub for reference.

## 03-24-2025 22:32
Updated devlog with notes on GitHub and committed to Git.

## Notes
This was my first project using Git, so I wasn’t entirely sure how to properly push and pull updates related to the project. I initially tried working on it using GitHub, but now I understand Git and how to use it effectively for future projects.
